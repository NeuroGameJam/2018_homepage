The Neuro Game Jam is the first game jam in Portugal to bring together neuroscientists and game developers.

Neuroscientists and Game Developers develop interactive environments, the first as experiments to answer a variety of questions focusing on precision and analytical capabilities, while the latter creates emotion-inducing, immersive and entertaining experiences.

What happens when the two collide?

The Neuro Game Jam invites both sides of this spectrum to get together and
create video games that can be used in real behavioural experiments that are scientifically informative, while remaining immersive and engaging for participants.

We invite you and your friends for a weekend of collaboration, from the 11th to the 13th of May at Universidade Lus√≥fona.
